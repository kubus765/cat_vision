# Cat Vision Converter

Simple app that changes hue and saturation to be as close as possible to a cat vision. I've made one because I didn't find any on the web

- Config for a cat color vision spectrum included (loads automatically)
- Works with JPG and PNG
- Takes a little while to process (be patient)
- Max image size 4000x4000


## To Do:

- Dog vision config (mostly will be the same)
- Better preview (right now it's as big as the image, that has to do with a bug that the image is saved according to the preview's size)
- Arrange the GUI better
- ???
