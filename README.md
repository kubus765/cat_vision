# Cat Vision Converter



Simple app that changes hue and saturation to be as close as possible to a cat vision. I've made one because I didn't find any on the web.
Keep in mind that cats are near-sighted. This is just a color correction/filter.

## Preview:
### Before:

### After:

## More info:
- Doesn't support night vision (obviously)
- Config for a cat color vision spectrum included (loads automatically)
- Works with JPG and PNG
- Takes a little while to process (be patient)
- Max image size 4000x4000


## To Do:

- Improve the algorithm (right now it's a bit half-assed)
- Dog vision config (mostly will be the same)
- Better preview (right now it's as big as the image, that has to do with a bug that the image is saved according to the preview's size)
- Arrange the GUI better
- ???
